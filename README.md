MERN stack application for thoughts and inspirations

### Outline
This application was put together using a MERN stack to provide an idea board-like space to post thoughts, but more specialized to musical compositions. The app is themed on Mt. Helicon, mythilogical home to the nine muses as more deeply explained in the homepage. A user in the app is given the space to add and save any musical thoughts that my come to mind. More specifically, they are prompted to flesh out key details like time signature, key signature, and more (which default to common western music standards). Additionally, the user is given the option to record temporarily, or permanenlty, musical notes in a simulated staff. This app was built with convenience and availability in mind.

#### Goals and Improvements
Many of the initial objectives of the project were ultimately achieved, however, as always, there is plenty of room to improve. An additional desired functionality of the app was to bring in 3rd party API access. Looking back at all-time classics can be great source of inspiration and reference for annotations and theory. Beyond adding functionality, the composition components could stand soem refined functionality. Aside from note style improvements, rests, clefts, measure breaks, and keysignatures usually present in compositions would serve to amplify an immersive experience when marking down a quick succession of notes, or even a few measures. The application was built with responsiveness in mind, but hasn't wholly hit the mark as a mobile-first application. The mobile-width stylings will need significant refactoring to hold up to contemporary mobile visual standards. 

### Planning
Having gone into this project with a working foundation of using MongoDB with mongoose and express, getting the application foundations set up proved straightforward and relatively seemless. Bringing in the React front-end then quickly fell into place. Beyond setups, the greatest planning obstacles were deciding ultimately what features to tackle. Between a 3rd party API and an interactive compositon feature, the compositon seemed the most direct adn immediate goal and was tehrefore pursued. At that phase of planning, the model was clear in mind, but the nature of its implementation was still hazy as evident in the ERD and wire-frames. In future projects, pursuing diverse options for post MVP wire-frames may prove more benefitial to workflow to avoid the hangups of making a clear picture out of a hazy goal.
